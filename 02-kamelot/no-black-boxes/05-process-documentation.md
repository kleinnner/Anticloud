## 1. Introduction

All of Kamelot's development and operational processes are documented in the repository. Nothing is hidden, nothing is informal, nothing is undocumented.

This document provides an overview of the key processes that govern Kamelot's development and maintenance.

---

## 2. Development Process

### 2.1 RFC Process

Significant changes follow a Request for Comments (RFC) process:

```
1. Idea → GitHub Discussion
2. Pre-RFC → Discussion refinement
3. RFC → Formal document submitted
4. Review → Community + maintainer feedback (2 weeks)
5. Decision → Accepted / Rejected / Revised
6. Implementation → RFC becomes GitHub issues
7. Merged → PR with implementation
```

RFCs are stored in `docs/rfcs/`:

```
docs/rfcs/
├── 0001-k-swarm-protocol.md
├── 0002-aioss-ledger.md
├── 0003-flat-store-format.md
├── 0004-encryption-architecture.md
└── ...
```
